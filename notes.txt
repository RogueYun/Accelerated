!? = I am not sure what to do about this one >.> HELP!


These refrences don't always hold true. I did leave out some "!~ LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT ~ CREATURE_MAT:ANIMAL" notes most of the creature files.

In a few of the creture files I noted these two reoccuring lines:
[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:ICHOR:ICHOR_TEMPLATE]!?
[BLOOD:CREATURE_MAT:ANIMAL:ICHOR:LIQUID]!?

The vanilla had these lines instead. Should I change them?
[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:BLOOD:BLOOD_TEMPLATE]
	[STATE_COLOR:ALL:BLUE] copper not iron based
[BLOOD:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:BLOOD:LIQUID]
